# Haxe-Examples

Haxe examples I am using to learn from, most of which were originally in js.

Some were provided by Ian Harrington to help, and a great help he has been, greatly appreciated.

Some of the examples may not fully function yet, as they have not been completely finished in haxe, but have been started enough to provide a working template until I return back to the example to complete it, as my understanding and skill improves, though any assistance is very much welcomed.

This is my way of learning Haxe and I am sharing in case it helps others to grasp and learn Haxe as well.

Though very similar to Javascript, there are some minior differences that can be confusing at first.
